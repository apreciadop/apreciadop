- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Alejandro Preciado PÃ©rez. I was born in Palma de Mallorca, on February 14, 1977. I am currently living in Miami, USA, since 2013, 
when the company I work for had the need to have Project Managers present here to support our clients in this part of the world. My company is located in 
the tourism sector, and is dedicated to renting its own software allowing various types of business (bed banks, travel agencies, OTAs...) to be able to sell 
tourism products through the different distribution channels that our system has.

- ðŸ‘€ My personal interests are reading books (I love the ones related to Conspiracy Theories, historic novels...). Ken Follet or Ildefonso Falcones are 
some of my favorite writers), computer games (but I have to recognize that I do not have enough time to play), trekking (a bit difficult here in MIami), 
going to the beach, running, soccer and some other sports.
